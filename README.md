Unicode Progress Bar
====================

A very simple function to draw a progress bar using Unicode.

The Unicode [block element](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters#Block_Elements)
symbols allow the graph to have a higher resolution than just one pixel by
character. That is each character has has 8 subdivisions.

Horizontally these symbols are used:
`▏` `▎` `▍` `▌` `▋` `▊` `▉` `█`

And vertically these symbols are used:
`▁` `▂` `▃` `▄` `▅` `▆` `▇` `█`
